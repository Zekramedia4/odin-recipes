        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This hot baked curried fruit can be served as a side dish or even dessert. It is a traditonal 
            southern recipe, ready for fall or winter. The curry brings a unique depth of flavor and complexity 
            to the fruit, while retaining sweetness (helped by the brown sugar of course). While canned
            fruit is typically used, feel free to use fresh, or even freestyle a bit with what fruits you 
            choose to include.</p>
